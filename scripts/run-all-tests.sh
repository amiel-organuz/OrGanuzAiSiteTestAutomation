Usage: run-all-tests.sh [dev|test|prod]

Runs the full local Playwright suite + server stack against a target environment.
The optional first argument selects the environment (default: dev):

  run-all-tests.sh dev     # dev product app (dev1.app.organize.organuz.com), password gate
  run-all-tests.sh prod    # prod product app (energy.organuz.com), no gate
  run-all-tests.sh         # same as dev

It sets QA_TARGET_ENV, which drives both the env/.<env>.env file loaded below and
the product baseURL resolved in playwright.config.ts. Env vars still override:
  MONITORING_ENABLED=true  include the live Govmap/Ofek monitoring project
  NOTIFY_SLACK=false       skip the end-of-run Slack post
  OPEN_BROWSER=false       do not open report tabs
EOF
}

# (e.g. `prd`) fails loudly instead of silently running dev.
