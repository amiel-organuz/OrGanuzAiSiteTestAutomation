description: Build or debug the Grafana/Prometheus/Pushgateway monitoring stack for the Organuz QA suite — dashboards from pushed Playwright metrics, plus the CPU/memory/network process metrics. Use when editing server/grafana, server/prometheus.yml, scripts/push-qa-metrics.mjs, or diagnosing empty dashboards.

# Organuz QA monitoring (Grafana + Prometheus + Pushgateway)

The local Docker stack (compose project `organuzaisitetestautomation`) turns Playwright results into a QA dashboard. Services: FastAPI `api` (8000, `/metrics`), Prometheus (host 9092→9090), **Pushgateway (host 9091)**, Grafana (host 3001, admin/admin, anon Viewer), Scalar (8080), Allure (5050). Start via `./scripts/run-all-tests.sh`.

## Metrics available
Prometheus (`server/prometheus.yml`) scrapes **three** targets: `prometheus`, `fastapi` (`api:8000`), and `pushgateway` (`pushgateway:9091`, `honor_labels: true`). CPU/mem/network are **process-level** from the FastAPI process: `process_cpu_seconds_total` (rate → cores), `process_resident_memory_bytes`, `process_virtual_memory_bytes`, `process_network_receive/transmit_bytes_total`, labelled by `job` (`fastapi`, `prometheus`). For true container/host metrics you'd add cAdvisor + node-exporter + scrape jobs.

QA test metrics are **pushed** to the Pushgateway by `scripts/push-qa-metrics.mjs` (a PUT to `/metrics/job/qa-playwright`, run at the end of `run-all-tests.sh`), which parses `test-results/results.json`: `qa_playwright_tests_total{project,status}`, `qa_playwright_duration_seconds{project}`, `qa_playwright_last_run_timestamp_seconds`, `qa_playwright_report_present`. The API no longer reads the results file — this is what removed the old stale-bind-mount bug. To refresh QA numbers by hand: `PUSHGATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:9091 node scripts/push-qa-metrics.mjs`.

## Dashboards
File-provisioned from `server/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/` (provider polls every 30s; folder "OrGanuz QA"). Datasource uid `Prometheus`. Existing: `qa-dashboard.json` and `system-and-tests-dashboard.json` (uid `organuz-system-tests` — current results, history, CPU/mem/network, with `$project`/`$job` template vars). To add a panel, edit the JSON (validate with `python3 -m json.tool`), wait ~30s, verify via `curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/dashboards/uid/<uid>`.
- When a status has no rows the series is absent → stat panels show "No data"; use `sum(...) or vector(0)`.

## The run script
`./scripts/run-all-tests.sh` drives the whole flow: `tsc --noEmit`, auto-start the stack (`docker compose up -d --build api swagger prometheus grafana pushgateway`) if it isn't already ready, run every non-credential-gated project in one invocation so Allure aggregates them, generate + serve the Allure report, then wait for `test-results/results.json` and push the QA metrics to the Pushgateway. It silences Node's `DEP0205` (module.register) so the log stays readable. `MONITORING_ENABLED=true` additionally runs the live Govmap/Ofek `monitoring` project (opt-in, see below). Dashboard link it prints/opens: `${GRAFANA_URL}/d/organuz-system-tests/organuz-system-and-test-monitor`.

## External hosting (optional Grafana Cloud)
GitHub Pages is a static host and can't run Grafana, so to publish an interactive dashboard you host Grafana externally and `remote_write` this Prometheus's metrics up to a hosted Prometheus (e.g. Grafana Cloud), which the hosted Grafana then queries — the same dashboard JSON renders. This is **scaffolded but commented off** in `server/prometheus.yml` (the `remote_write` block) and `docker-compose.yml` (the token bind mount). To enable: create a Grafana Cloud stack, note its Prometheus `remote_write` URL + instance ID (username), create a `MetricsPublisher` token, put it one-line in the **gitignored** `server/grafana-cloud-token`, then uncomment the compose token mount and the prometheus `remote_write` block (set `url` + `username`). Never commit the token.

## Slack + external-API monitoring
- **Slack report from local runs:** at the end of `run-all-tests.sh` (unless `NOTIFY_SLACK=false`) it posts the Allure + Grafana links to every configured webhook. Two independent, optional webhooks: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `SLACK_WEBHOOK_BOT_URL`, sourced from the gitignored `.env` locally and from GitHub repo secrets of the same names on CI. An unset webhook is skipped; a failed post is non-fatal. `scripts/slack-alert-test.sh` posts a clearly-marked TEST message to each configured webhook (never printing the URLs) to smoke-test wiring.
- **`.github/workflows/monitoring.yml` (External API Monitoring):** a **separate** workflow from the PR gate. On a `*/30` cron it runs only the live Govmap + Ofek `monitoring` project (`MONITORING_ENABLED=true`, `--project=monitoring`, APIRequestContext-only so no browser install). On failure it opens/refreshes a single auto-managed GitHub issue (label `monitoring-alert`) and pings both Slack webhooks; the next green run comments and closes the issue. The `force_fail` `workflow_dispatch` input fails on purpose to exercise the alert path (issue + Slack) without a real outage. Keeping this out of the PR suite means a map-dependency outage never fails the green PR gate.

## Gotchas
- **Port 8000 conflict:** a leftover `ai_automation_testing` compose stack also binds 8000. If startup fails with "port is already allocated": `docker stop ai_automation_testing-automation-server-1`.
- **Empty test panels:** if `qa_playwright_*` is missing, the push didn't happen. Check the Pushgateway has the group (`curl -s http://localhost:9091/metrics | grep qa_playwright`) and that Prometheus scrapes it (`pushgateway` target healthy at `http://localhost:9092/targets`). Re-push with `node scripts/push-qa-metrics.mjs`. (The old "restart api to unstick a stale bind mount" fix is gone — the API no longer reads the results file.)
- **Editing `server/prometheus.yml` doesn't take effect:** the config is a read-only bind mount, so a running Prometheus keeps the old config. Force it: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate prometheus` (or hit `/-/reload`).
